# RGB-Sound-Automization
Project to automize the color of RGB strip lighting to the baseline and percussion of a song using realtime FFT (Fast-Fourier Transform). The sound is inputted to the computer either through microphone or internal audio channel and the analysis is begun. The program measures the frequencies at 4 different frequencies and applies a logarithmic regression algorithm to smooth the frequency values. These frequency values are compared to previous frequency values and determines if there was a major increase, indicating a beat in the song such as a heavy drum. Light levels are generated to display a randomly selected RGB color that decays over a few seconds. This data is sent over serial to an Arduino with a circuit containing 3 MOSFETs to control each RGB channel. The light levels are mimicked to the RGB strips and the result is a flashing RGB light strip!
